### Output Formats

Zanadir supports two output formats: table (default) and JSON.

#### Table Output (Default)

```sh

```

**Sample Output:**
```

    "Name": "Performance and Reliability Testing Tools",
    "Description": "Tools for measuring code coverage to ensure testing completeness and software quality.",
    "Suggestions": [
      {
        "Name": "k6",
        "Repository": "https://github.com/grafana/k6",
        "Description": "Grafana k6 is an open-source, developer-friendly, and extensible load testing tool. k6 allows you to prevent performance issues and proactively improve reliability.",

        "Name": "JMeter",
        "Repository": "https://github.com/apache/jmeter",
        "Description": "An Apache project designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance, with support for various protocols and servers.",
        "Language": ""
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Exclude Specific Categories

Skip certain categories during analysis:

```sh
zanadir scan --dir . --excluded-categories "SCA,Secrets"
```

#### Enforce Mode

Zanadir provides an `--enforce` flag to ensure that all CI/CD suggestions are fulfilled. If any suggestion is not met, the CI pipeline will fail. This helps enforce security best practices and compliance in automated workflows.

```sh
zanadir scan --dir . --enforce
```

#### Debug Mode

Get detailed logging information:

```sh
zanadir scan --dir . --debug
```

#### Complete Example

```sh
# Scan with all options
zanadir scan \
  --dir /path/to/repo \
  --output json \
  --excluded-categories "Linter" \
  --enforce \
  --debug
```
